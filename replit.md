# Multi-League Football API

## Overview
This project provides a professional, real-time scraping API for multiple football leagues. Its primary purpose is to deliver up-to-date data including league standings, top scorers, news, teams, logos, and YouTube videos (for Liga MX). The API aims to be a reliable and comprehensive source of football statistics and information, serving as a backend for sports applications, data analysis, and news platforms. It supports Liga MX, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1, with an ambitious vision to expand to more leagues and real-time features.

## User Preferences
I prefer clear and concise information. When making changes, prioritize modularity and scalability. I value detailed explanations for complex architectural decisions. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file.

## System Architecture
The project is built on Node.js 20 with Express 4.21, designed for high performance and scalability.

**Technical Implementations:**
*   **Multi-Source Scraping System (NEW - Oct 2025):** Revolutionary failover architecture that queries 3 independent data sources per league (ESPN, Soccerway, FlashScore) with intelligent fallback. If the primary source fails or is slow, the system automatically switches to the next available source, ensuring maximum uptime and the freshest data possible. All responses include source metadata (fuente, fuente_url, tiempo_scraping_ms) for transparency.
*   **Dynamic Caching System:** An in-memory cache stores data for 30 minutes, significantly reducing external requests and improving response times. It supports dynamic keys for various leagues and data types.
*   **Automated Updates:** `node-cron` schedules automatic data refreshes every 30 minutes for Liga MX endpoints, ensuring data freshness.
*   **Anti-detection Mechanisms:** To prevent blocking, the API employs User-Agent rotation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), realistic HTTP headers, random delays (1-3 seconds), exponential backoff for retries (up to 3 attempts), and rate limit handling (429 status codes).
*   **Modular Scraper Architecture:** Scrapers are organized by league and data type with source adapters in `src/scrapers/sources/<league>/` directories. Each league has dedicated adapters for ESPN, Soccerway, and FlashScore, all coordinated through `src/utils/multiSourceScraper.js`.
*   **Data Sources:** Data is aggregated from multiple reliable sources (ESPN, Soccerway, FlashScore, BBC Sport, Mediotiempo), with automatic failover between sources to guarantee data availability even if individual sources experience downtime or rate limiting.
*   **Endpoint Design:** The API offers 35 operational endpoints across 6 leagues, including detailed calendar endpoints with matchday information and live countdowns for all supported leagues. Includes a unified `/calendario/todas-las-ligas` endpoint that aggregates complete fixture data from all leagues with professional metadata.
*   **Video Integration (Liga MX):** A dedicated endpoint scrapes YouTube for Liga MX highlight videos, providing comprehensive metadata without relying on the YouTube API quota.
*   **Mejores Momentos (NEW - Oct 2025):** YouTube highlights scraping for all leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1) with categorized content (mejores momentos, highlights, res√∫menes, repeticiones), returning up to 50 recent videos per league with complete metadata (title, description, channel, thumbnail, duration, views, publish date, URLs).
*   **Logo Integration (Liga MX):** Provides high-quality team logos in multiple sizes from ESPN's CDN.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
*   While this is a backend API, future considerations for client-side applications would prioritize a clean, responsive design with intuitive data presentation.

**Feature Specifications:**
*   **League Data:** Comprehensive standings, top scorers, and news for all supported leagues.
*   **Liga MX Specifics:** Includes team lists, logos (4 sizes), and YouTube video highlights (up to 50 recent videos with metadata).
*   **Calendar with Matchdays:** Provides detailed fixture lists, including matchday numbers, team names, dates, times, and a live countdown to each match for all leagues.
*   **Unified Calendar Endpoint:** `/calendario/todas-las-ligas` provides a professional aggregated view of all fixtures across all 6 leagues with complete information (jornada, teams, dates, times, countdowns) and structured metadata (updated timestamp, total leagues, total matches per league).
*   **Mejores Momentos Endpoints:** All 5 European leagues now feature `/mejores-momentos` endpoints that scrape YouTube for league-specific highlights, best moments, and match summaries. Content is automatically categorized and cached for optimal performance.

## External Dependencies
*   **Node.js 20:** JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **Express 4.21:** Web application framework for Node.js.
*   **Axios 1.12:** Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external sources.
*   **Cheerio 1.1:** Fast, flexible, and lean implementation of core jQuery specifically designed for the server, used for HTML parsing.
*   **node-cron 4.2:** Library for scheduling tasks in Node.js.
*   **googleapis:** Google APIs client for Node.js, specifically used for interacting with YouTube (though web scraping is used for video data to avoid quota limits).
*   **ESPN, Mediotiempo, BBC Sport, FlashScore:** Primary data sources for football statistics and news.
